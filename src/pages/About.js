      <h1>About Me</h1>
      
      <p>Hello! My name is Seth Martineau and I'm a 26 year old graduate from the University of
      Utah. I am currently enrolled in a coding bootcamp because I wanted a career change. Coding so far has been
      challenging and rewarding. I hope to learn more and am able to use these skills I learn to better myself for
      future employment.</p>

      <p>Outside of coding, I am just like you, trying to find things to do so I don't become a hermit after
      quarantine. I like hanging with friends (pre-quarantine), eating out, playing video games, and shopping. I
      love spicy and sweet foods so chicken wings are my favorite. If you have any wing suggestions send me a
      message in my <a href="./contact.html">Contact Me</a> page. I play computer games with my friends and even
      more now because of quarantine. My favorite game to play is <a href="https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/">League of Legends</a>.
      Lastly I enjoy shopping, mainly thrift shopping. I like to buy and sell clothes on the side as a fun hobby because you never know what you
      will find and it's a bonus when it's worth more than you paid!</p>
